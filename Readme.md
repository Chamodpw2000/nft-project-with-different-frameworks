# NFT Project with Different Frameworks

Welcome to my NFT project! This repository is a hands-on journey through the world of smart contract development, NFT standards, and modern blockchain tooling. Here, I experiment with multiple frameworks and tools to build, test, and deploy an ERC-721 NFT contract called **CodingLion**.

## üöÄ What I Learned

- **Solidity Smart Contracts**: Wrote and customized ERC-721 contracts, including metadata, minting, and ownership logic.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: Leveraged secure, audited libraries for ERC721, Ownable, and URI storage extensions.
- **Hardhat**: Used for local development, testing, and deployment. Learned about scripts, config, and Ethers.js integration.
- **Truffle**: Explored classic Ethereum development with migrations, tests, and contract artifacts.
- **Foundry**: Discovered blazing-fast testing and scripting with Forge, cheatcodes, and Solidity-native tests.
- **Testing**: Wrote tests in both JavaScript (Hardhat/Truffle) and Solidity (Foundry), including access control, minting, and error handling.
- **Deployment**: Practiced deploying contracts to local and public testnets (Sepolia), including verification on Etherscan.
- **Environment Management**: Managed secrets and RPC URLs with `.env` files for secure and flexible configuration.
- **Git & GitHub**: Versioned my code, published the repo, and learned best practices for open-source collaboration.

## ü¶Å The CodingLion NFT
- Implements ERC-721 with URI storage and ownership.
- Features a `safeMint` function for the owner and a public `buyToken` function for users to purchase NFTs.
- Metadata hosted at: `https://nft-721-token-coding-lion.vercel.app/<tokenId>`

## üìö Frameworks & Tools Used
- **Solidity**
- **Hardhat**
- **Truffle**
- **Foundry (Forge)**
- **OpenZeppelin**
- **Ethers.js**
- **Infura/Alchemy**
- **Etherscan**

## üß™ How to Run
- Install dependencies for each framework (`npm install`, `forge install`, etc.)
- Compile and test contracts with Hardhat, Truffle, and Foundry.
- Deploy to Sepolia using scripts and environment variables.

## üí° Key Takeaways
- How different frameworks approach contract development and testing.
- The importance of secure, well-tested code in blockchain projects.
- How to manage deployments, verifications, and environment secrets.
- The value of open-source collaboration and documentation.
